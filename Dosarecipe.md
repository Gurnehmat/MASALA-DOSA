Recipe of dosa:
(1) Take 1.5 cups idli rice or parboiled rice in one bowl.
(2) Take ½ cup urad dal + 1 tablespoon chana dal + 20 methi seeds (fenugreek seeds) in a second bowl.
(3) Take ⅓ cup thick poha (flattened rice) in a third bowl.
(4) Rinse the lentils and methi seeds a couple of times. Then soak them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours.
(5) Rinse the rice a couple of times and keep aside.
(6) Rinse poha once or twice and then add to the rice.
(7) Pour 2 cups water. Stir and soak both rice and poha together for 4 to 5 hours.
(8)  Before grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils+methi seeds and keep it for grinding urad dal.
(9) Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the dal.
(10) Grind the urad dal, chana dal and methi seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.
(11)  Remove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula. Here is a pic showing the consistency of the batter.
(12) Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. I ground in one batch and added 1 cup water for grinding. You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.
(13) Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava like consistency in the batter.
(14) Now pour the rice+poha batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad dal batter.
(15) Add ½ teaspoon rock salt or add as per taste.
(16) Mix the salt very well with the batter. Also, mix both the batters very well. Cover and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours. You can keep for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city.
(17) The batter is ready the next day. 

Recipe for potato masala:
(1) First rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker. You can also boil potatoes in a pan. The potatoes have to be completely cooked.
(2)  When the potatoes are cooking, soak the chana dal in hot water for 30 minutes. Then drain the chana dal and keep aside.
(3)When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the potatoes and let them become warm.
(4)Then peel them and chop them. Also, slice the onions and chop the green chilies, ginger and coriander leaves.
(5) Heat oil or ghee. If using cashews, then fry cashews at this step and keep them aside. Lower the flame and add mustard seeds and let them splutter. You can add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds while tempering in the potato masala.
(6)Then add the chana dal.
(7)Saute the chana dal for 2 to 3 minutes on a low flame or till they turn light golden or golden.
(8)Now add the sliced onions, curry leaves, green chilies and ginger.
(9)Saute the onions till they soften and turn translucent.
(10)Add the turmeric powder and asafoetida.

(13)Again mix well and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes or till the mixture thickens a bit.
(14) Next add the boiled chopped potatoes.
(15)Mix very well.
(16)Season with salt. Also add ¼ teaspoon sugar for a slightly sweet taste. You can add more sugar if you prefer.
(17)And stir again.
(18)simmer on a low flame to medium-low flame for 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally.
(19)Switch off the flame and then add chopped coriander leaves. also add fried cashews now (if you have fried the cashews earlier as mentioned in step 5 above). Mix well.
(20)Stir and keep the potato masala aside. the potato masala should be moist and easily spreadable on the dosa. Make sure there is no water in the potato masala. It should not be of a curry or gravy consistency. This is your basic potato masala for the masala dosa.

MAKING MASALA DOSA:
1. Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. you will also see tiny air pockets in the batter.
2. Heat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don’t smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won’t be able to spread the batter.
3. Keep the flame to a low, while spreading batter.
4. Spread the batter in a circular way on the pan. on a medium flame, cook the dosa.
5. Sprinkle some oil on top and edges.
6. cover the dosa with a lid and let it cook.
7. Cook the dosa till its base becomes golden and crisp.
8. when you see the base has become golden, place a portion of the potato masala on the dosa. You can spread it a bit if you want.
9. Now fold the dosa and serve.
10. Serve crispy masala dosa with hot sambar and coconut chutney.
